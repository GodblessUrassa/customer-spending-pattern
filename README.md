# Customer Spending Analysis
SellCheapy Retail is a chain of department stores that sells a wide range of products, including bikes and different components. Despite having a large customer base, the company has been struggling to increase sales in recent years. The management team is looking to use data analysis to understand customer spending patterns and make changes to their sales and marketing strategies to improve performance. The company collected data on customer demographics, purchasing history, and other relevant information over the course of a year. The data includes information on the products purchased, the price paid, and the date of purchase, etc.

# Business problem
The company is having difficulties to increase sales

# Project goal
To give insights on customer spending patterns and recommend actions to be taken to increase sales

# Data importation
The data is from AdventureWorks database. The AdventureWorks database supports standard online transaction processing scenarios for a fictitious bicycle manufacturer (Adventure Works Cycles). Scenarios include Manufacturing, Sales, Purchasing, Product Management, Contact Management, and Human Resources. 7 tables and 1 view were used from sales, people and product management scenarios. The tables are Sales.Customer, Sales.SalesOrderDetail, Sales.SalesOrderHeader, Person.Person, Sales.vPersonDemographics, Production.Product, Production.ProductCategory, Production.ProductSubcategory. 

Power BI was connected to SQL server database to access SellCheapy retail data.

# Data transformation
The imported data was transformed by power query before being loaded.

In transformation, the common activities done are changing data types, removing columns that weren't used, merging queries, renaming columns, reordering columns, and filtering. 

# Data modeling
I used a star schema data model to organize data for easy understanding and analysis. Sales.SalesOrderHeader was a fact table.

# Analysis
The analysis was done in two segments, that is analysis based on demographic data of customers and analysis based on purchasing history of customers. 

### RFM analysis
RFM analysis was done using purchasing history data.
* Recency is the number of years since the last order was placed by a customer. The purpose was to understand customer relationship with the company and how many customers did the company lost or is at risk of losing which will decrease company sales
* Frequency is the total number of orders placed by a customer. The purpose was to understand how frequently orders are placed.
* Monetary is the sum of total due per order. The purpose was to understand customer spending per order. 

### Terms meaning
* TotalDue - total money a customer is paying. It includes tax, freight and subtotal
* List price - selling price of the product

* Components - bicycle components example chains and brakes
